# Image handling for WordPress
WordPress plugin. Redirect all JPG requests to a PHP script so that watermarking can take place on-the-fly. No images will be cached on the server.

## Usage
Install the plugin and use the options (Settings Â» Image handling) to control the addition of a watermark to all JPG images.

Plain text watermarks will be available in a future version.
